				<h3>The Martian</h3>
				<p> The Martian is a 2015 American[nb 1] science fiction film directed by Ridley Scott and starring Matt Damon. The film is based on Andy Weir's 2011 novel The Martian, which was adapted into a screenplay by Drew Goddard. Damon stars as an astronaut who is incorrectly presumed dead and left behind on the planet Mars, and who then fights to survive. </p>
				<p>The movie has been a huge success in the box office (mostly due to the recent Mars related announcement by NASA). If only NASA could have the same funding as the space station, we may really be able to put Matt Damon on Mars someday. I doubt it thoug. Seems rather unlikely. Maybe we should invest more on saving out inviromnet though.</p>
				<p>I am running out of things to say about Mars and this movie. The cinematography was nice. I was impressed on how they managed to adapt the log-based book into a movie. Matt Damond only looked somewhat crazy as he talked to himself. I wonder if we would really go thtough all that trouble to save an astronaut. My understanding is that being an astronaut is rather dangerous and that one such astronaut would know the risks before-hand. I think we would not. But then again I'm not Nasa. Does anything I am writing make any sense ? I would not know; this is all happening at 2am. I'm gonna finish the rest of this website, bye. </p>
